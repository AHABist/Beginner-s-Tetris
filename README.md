# Beginner-s-Tetris

Obviously i'm a total newbie

This is my first attempt to use github.
I've been learning JS for a bit more then 6 months now.
For the first time i'm trying to build a polished little program that i can show to my friends.
I try to use ES6 classes and modules.
Once i've got the game working, i will try to refactor/clean up my code.
